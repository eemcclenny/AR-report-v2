Here, an all-season analysis of AR incidence in the North Pacific basin is performed for the period spanning 1979–2014 using the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis dataset. An occurrence-based detection algorithm is developed and employed to identify and characterize ARs in instantaneous fields of anomalous vertically integrated water vapor transport. The all-season climatology and variability of AR frequencies due to the seasonal cycle, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), and their interactions are presented based on composites of the detected features. The results highlight that ARs exist throughout the year over the North Pacific, although their preferred locations shift substantially throughout the year. This seasonal cycle manifests itself as northward and westward displacement of ARs during the Northern Hemisphere warm seasons, rather than an absolute change in the number of ARs within the domain. It is also shown that changes to the North Pacific mean-state due to ENSO and the MJO may enhance or completely offset the seasonal cycle of AR activity, but that such influences on AR frequencies vary greatly based on location. }

abstract = {Abstract Several case studies are presented showing the structure of ana-cold fronts over the British Isles. One of the cases is analysed in detail using data acquired on the Isles of Scilly to avoid any confusing effects due to topography. All of the fronts described are characterized by a narrow band of shallow but vigorous convection at the surface cold front; this convection is essentially two-dimensional and is termed line convection. In each case the line convection is bounded on its forward side by a low-level jet reaching 25 to 30 m s−1; behind the line convection the winds decrease abruptly. The low-level jet is embedded within a ‘convective boundary layer’, reaching its maximum velocity at 900 to 850 mb, and it consists of a tongue of anomalously warm, moist air, which has had a trajectory over an even warmer sea. It is shown that the line convection can be regarded as part of a mesoscale ‘right-hand corkscrew circulation’ within the low-level jet. The line convection constitutes one flank of the jet; it is characterized by very strong cyclonic shear and is fed by frictional convergence of air from beneath the jet core within the lowest 100 mb. Some of the air which ascends within the line convection subsequently flows forward and gently subsides within the upper part of the low-level jet as part of the corkscrew circulation; however, most of the air which ascends within the line convection is extruded from the boundary layer and ascends in a rearward direction as slantwise convection above the inclined cold frontal zone. Precipitation grown in the slantwise convection falls into the cold air behind the surface cold front and the heat sink resulting from the partial evaporation of this precipitation probably accentuates the sharpness of the boundary of the low-level jet at the surface cold front.}

    abstract = { Abstract An elongated cold-frontal maximum in the lower-tropospheric potential vorticity (PV) field accompanies some midlatitude cyclones. These PV maxima are often of diabatic origin, and are hypothesized to contribute substantially to the strength of the low-level jet (LLJ) and moisture transport in the cyclone warm sector. Diagnosis of a representative cyclone event from the central United States during February 1997 is presented with the goals of (i) elucidating the mechanisms of development and propagation of the cold-frontal PV band, and (ii) clarifying the relation between this PV maximum and the LLJ. A confluent upper trough and modest surface cyclone followed a track from the south-central United States northeastward into southern Ontario between 26 and 28 February 1997, accompanied by flooding and widespread straight-line wind damage. A LLJ, with maximum wind speeds in excess of 35 m s−1, was positioned at the western extremity of the cyclone warm sector, immediately east of an elongated PV maximum in the lower troposphere. Results of an Ertel PV budget confirm the importance of latent heat release to the development and eastward propagation of the PV band. Cancellation was observed between the vertical PV advection, which yielded negative (positive) tendencies beneath (above) the cold-frontal PV maximum, and the nonadvective PV tendency, which was positive (negative) beneath (above) the level of maximum heating. The nonadvective PV flux is directed opposite the absolute vorticity vector; therefore vertical wind shear (associated with westward-tilting absolute vorticity vectors) led to eastward nonadvective propagation of the PV maximum. Quasigeostrophic PV inversion indicates that the cold-frontal PV maximum contributed between 15\% and 40\% to the strength of the LLJ within the cyclone warm sector. The results of this study suggest that a complex interdependence can exist between cold-frontal rainbands, lower-tropospheric PV maxima, the LLJ, and warm-sector moisture transport. The implications of this linkage for numerical weather forecasting are discussed. }

abstract = {Abstract Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are long (>2000 km) and narrow (500–1000 km) corridors of enhanced vertically integrated water vapor and enhanced integrated water vapor transport (IVT) that are responsible for a majority of global poleward moisture transport and can result in extreme orographic precipitation. Observational evidence suggests that ARs within different synoptic-scale flow regimes may contain different water vapor source regions, orientations, and intensities and may result in different precipitation distributions. This study uses k-means clustering to objectively identify different orientations and intensities of ARs that make landfall over the California Russian River watershed. The ARs with different orientations and intensities occur within different synoptic-scale flow patterns in association with variability in IVT direction and quasi-geostrophic forcing for ascent and lead to different precipitation distributions over the Russian River watershed. These differences suggest that both mesoscale upslope moisture flux and synoptic-scale forcing for ascent are important factors in modulating precipitation distributions during landfalling ARs.}
